## 💻 KegLevel Lite Project
 
The **KegLevel Lite** app is a "stripped-down" version of the **KegLevel Monitor** app. It allows homebrewers to monitor and track the level of beer in up to 5 kegs.

Currently tested only on the Raspberry Pi 3B running Trixie and Bookworm. Should work with RPi4 and RPi5 running the same OS's but not yet tested.

Please **donate $$** if you use the app.
